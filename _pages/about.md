The solutions include single microphone and microphone array variants suitable
for various denoising needs, including:

- environmental noise suppression;
- interfering voice suppression, especially for face-to-face communication.

##### Applications

- Hearing aids
- Hearables
- Voice assistants
- Speech processing on mobile and embedded devices
- Voice-operated IoT devices
